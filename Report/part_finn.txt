Several technical challenges arose while programming, both in the pre-visualization data wrangling and in the processing of the data with JavaScript. During the pre-processing we quickly noticed that the amount of raw data did not translate well to a straight forward force simulation like in the work done by the Swedish Newspaper. Even our high powered Laptops where not able to fluently simulate over ten thousand dots. Brexit day alone had 500,000 users we wanted to visualize. To fix this problem, we decided to let one circle in our simulation represent 100 users from our data. Keeping the distribution was achieved by grouping the users into bins and then keeping the bins with more than 100 users. This was possible as we only needed the account age accurate to the month, and didn't have to handle the continuous time data. User data is compressed into only the relevant rows, 'Location', 'Position', 'screenname' and 'account age' and saved as a csv file. The biggest problem during the development of the website was hot-swapping the different data sets to achieve the three different visualizations and getting the location data to appear correctly on a svg map. We decided on using a mercator-projection, but cutting off the poles. This alteration caused many complications and we had to adapt our own conversion formula. In the end we decided to set the resolution to a fixed 1219 by 700 pixels as it does accommodate most macs and does not have a negative impact on the viewing experience. We also abandoned the scrolling idea, as it is only suitable for visualization of data where every possible state of the force simulation is reachable by every other state. As we are swapping data in and out, which takes a considerable time to load, skipping over triggers by scrolling too fast would break the visualization.
