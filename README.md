# What does Twitter have to say about Brexit?

This data set comes from the Neuropolitics Research Lab at the University of Edinburgh, a transdisciplinary research centre that utilises developments in cognitive neurosciences to shed light on new political attitudes, identities and behaviours. Their aim with providing this large data set was to provide new insights into how citizens' Brexit-related expectations are shaped in a digital world. How have their expectations about Brexit changed? Have their expectations changed from when they voted? What are the perceptions of digital authenticity and trust?  

Brexit-related Tweets in this visualisation come from the following days: Referendum (23 June 2016) Pre-Referendum (21-22 June 2016) Post- Referendum (22-23 September 2017, Florence Speech)
